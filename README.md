Quiz Scores Program  

This project was created as part of Lab 5 for the course Business Application Programming at Florida International University (FIU). The program demonstrates how to use Python lists, loops, and random number generation to manage quiz scores.  

What it does:  

• Generates a list of 10 random quiz scores between 0 and 100  
• Calculates and prints the average, lowest, and highest scores  
• Replaces the lowest score with the highest score and recalculates the average  
• Selects random scores using the choice and sample methods  
• Sorts and shuffles the list to demonstrate list manipulation  
• Iterates over the list to show each score and its distance from the average  

How to run:  

1. Download the file casasnovas_lab5.py  
2. Open a terminal or IDE and run: python casasnovas_lab5.py  
3. Follow the program output displayed in the console  

Note: The numbers will differ each time the program runs because they are randomly generated.
